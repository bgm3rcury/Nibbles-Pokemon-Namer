            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <h3>What information is collected?</h3>
            <p>When you use Nibbles, we collect some basic information about you, such as your Discord username and Discord ID. This information is used to provide personalized features and identify users.</p>
            <p>In addition to user data, Nibbles collects information about the servers it is invited to, such as the server's channels and server ID. This information is used to provide server-specific features and improve the bot's overall performance.</p>
            <h3>How is the information used?</h3>
            <p>We use the information we collect to improve the functionality of Nibbles, to provide better customer service, and to comply with legal requirements.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Personalized features: We use your Discord username and Discord ID to provide personalized features, such as commands and notifications that can be custom set for you/your server.</li>
                <li>Improved functionality: We use the information about your interactions with Nibbles to improve the accuracy of our responses and suggestions. We also use this information to identify and troubleshoot bugs.</li>
                <li>Legal compliance: We comply with legal requirements, such as those related to data protection and intellectual property. For example, we only share your information with third parties when we are legally required to do so, such as when responding to a subpoena or court order.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Who has access to the information?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Developer team: The developer team has indirect access to the information by making use of the official Discord API required to provide the bot's functions.</li>
                <li>Third parties: We primarily only share your information with one third party, Discord itself, who helps us operate Nibbles. We also share your information with third parties when we are legally required to do so, such as when responding to a subpoena or court order.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Your choices about the information.</h3>
            <p>By adding Nibbles to your server, you agree to the automatic collection of basic needed data to provide its functionality. However, you have the right to request access to and deletion of your data.</p>
            <h3>Requesting access to/deletion of data</h3>
            <p>You can request the deletion of/access to your data by creating an admin ticket at #create・ticket.</p>
            <p>Data deletion will automatically lead to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All custom set ping roles will be deleted from Nibble's memory.</li>
                <li>Starboard channel will be deleted from Nibble's memory.</li>
                <li>Your personal pings will be deleted from Nibble's memory.</li>
                <li>The bot will leave your server and delete server-related data from memory.</li>
                <li>All data of direct messages with the bot will be deleted.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>At that point, it would be as if the bot was never added to your server/you never used the bot before.</p>
            <h3>Changes to this privacy policy.</h3>
            <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time.</p>
